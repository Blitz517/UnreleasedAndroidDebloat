- [x] **I removed all those packages on my phone**

## Document each package the best you can

### com.miui.powerkeeper

**List**: `OEM`
**Removal**: `Unsafe`

> Battery and Performance
> (aggressive) MIUI power management (https://dontkillmyapp.com/xiaomi)
> Hidden power tools, Extreme Battery Saver, sleep mode and more.
> Its not unneccesary app. Keep it for powersaving.
> On miui 14 it can bootloop but not sure if its true.

### com.xiaomi.powerchecker

**List**: `OEM`
**Removal**: `Unsafe`

> Power Detector. Security> Battery> Activity Control.
> Detects abnormal power usage by apps (not all. Some Xiaomi apps are whitelisted)
> Needed for 'com.miui.powerkeeper' to work.
> Its not unneccesary app. Keep it for powersaving.
> On miui 14 it can bootloop but not sure if its true.

### com.android.providers.calendar

**List**: `AOSP`
**Removal**: `Advanced`

> Calendar Storage. Runs in the background.
> You should be fine if you dont use anything that require Calendar.
> Necessary for the stock Calendar app to work correctly.
> Content providers encapsulate data, providing centralized management of data shared between apps.
> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html

### com.android.camera

**List**: `AOSP`
**Removal**: `Advanced`

> Stock camera app.
> On xiaomi you should keep it, because google camera is not better.

### com.xiaomi.finddevice

**List**: `OEM`
**Removal**: `Unsafe`

> Find My Device feature (in the Settings)
> Enables you to locate your lost phone and erase your data remotely.
> Your phone needs to be connected to internet (Wifi/mobile data) for this feature to work.
> REMOVING THIS PACKAGE WILL BOOTLOOP YOUR DEVICE!
> NOTE : You cannot disable it via adb
> According some sources, disabling MIUI optimizations in the Developer
> settings and removing the apk file in a custom recovery does not cause a
> bootloop, but I didn't test this.
> So you can only remove permissions using settings.

### com.miui.cleanmaster

**List**: `OEM`
**Removal**: `Recommended`

> Mi Cleaner. If you wont remove it then Restrict data usage and restrict in the background, but I am not sure if it helps.
> Shady Xiaomi cleaner app developed by Cheetah mobile which has previously been caught in ad fraud and user data theft in 2018. 
> The app has been banned from the PlayStore and then reintroduced under the package name 'com.miui.cleaner'.
> https://www.gadgets360.com/apps/news/banned-security-app-clean-master-by-cheetah-mobile-collected-user-private-data-report-2189633

### com.google.android.apps.googleassistant

**List**: `Google`
**Removal**: `Recommanded`

> Google Assistant (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googleassistant)
> Microphone always is on when you enabled OK GOOGLE.

### com.google.android.gms

**List**: `Google`
**Removal**: `Expert`

> Google Play Services, gms = Google Mobile Services
> It is a layer that sits on top of the OS and provides a bunch of Google APIs, giving apps access to various Google Services.
> If you remove it all the apps relying on Google Play Services whill either:
> detect the lack of play services and refuse to run or allow you to run (improperly) by dismissing an annoying popup
> Disabling this package can improve battery life.
> IMPORTANT: You need to uncheck Find My Device from the \"Device admin apps\" settings panel to be able to disable this package.
> Search \"admin\" in the settings search bar.
> If you wanna keep some privacy you will need to use nextDNS to blocking trackers, ads and disable some permissions.
> some people like to use microG but it doesnt keep your privacy that much and require custom os, root and Spoofing Signature support.

### com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox

> Google Search box (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox)

> that additionally doesn't run in the background constantly like this package does.
